# Required Models for Simple Portrait Generator

## Checkpoint Models (place in ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/)
- realisticVisionV51_v51VAE.safetensors
  - Download: https://civitai.com/models/4201/realistic-vision-v51
  - Size: ~5.1 GB
  - Description: High-quality realistic portrait generation model
  - Version: V5.1 with baked-in VAE

## Alternative Models (compatible replacements)
- Any Stable Diffusion 1.5 based checkpoint will work
- For better results, use models trained on portrait/people datasets
- SDXL models require changing resolution to 1024x1024

## Notes
- The workflow includes VAE decoding, so models with built-in VAE are recommended
- For models without built-in VAE, you may need to load a separate VAE file
- Test with different checkpoints to find your preferred style
