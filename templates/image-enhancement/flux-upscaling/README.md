**Source:** OpenArt.ai (by Gabriel Jiménez)  
**Type:** LoRA-enhanced Upscaling  

**Description:**
Comprehensive upscaling pipeline combining Flux model with specialized LoRA models for targeted enhancement. Includes face restoration and detail refinement.

**Key Features:**
- 🧠 LoRA model integration for specialized enhancement
- 👤 Face restoration capabilities
- 🎨 Artistic style preservation
- ⚙️ Multiple upscaling stages
- 🔧 Customizable enhancement parameters

## ⚙️ Technical Specifications

### System Requirements
- **GPU Memory:** 12GB+ VRAM recommended for 4K upscaling
- **Models Required:**
  - Flux.1 base model
  - ControlNet models (Canny, Depth)
  - Upscaling LoRA models
  - Face restoration models

### Performance Metrics
- **2x Upscaling:** ~30-60 seconds (depending on input size)
- **4x Upscaling:** 2-5 minutes
- **Maximum Input:** 2048x2048 recommended
- **Output Quality:** Professional grade, print-ready

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Flux ControlNet Upscale
1. Load your input image (optimal: 512-1024px)
2. Select upscaling factor (2x, 4x recommended)
3. Choose ControlNet type (Canny for edges, Depth for structure)
4. Adjust strength parameters (0.7-1.0 typical)
5. Configure output settings and run

### Flux LoRA Upscaler Advanced
1. Import base image
2. Select appropriate LoRA models for your content type
3. Configure upscaling stages (typically 2-3 stages)
4. Set face restoration strength if applicable
5. Fine-tune detail enhancement parameters
6. Execute multi-stage upscaling process

## 📊 Quality Comparison

| Method | Speed | Quality | VRAM | Best For |
|--------|-------|---------|------|----------|
| ControlNet | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 12GB | Architectural, detailed images |
| LoRA Advanced | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 16GB | Portraits, artistic content |

## 🎯 Optimization Tips

### For Best Quality:
- Use images with good base quality (avoid heavily compressed)
- Choose appropriate ControlNet based on image content
- Experiment with CFG scale (7-12 range typically works well)
- Use multiple passes for extreme upscaling (8x+)

### For Speed:
- Reduce number of sampling steps (20-30 instead of 50+)
- Use lower CFG scale (6-8)
- Process smaller batches
- Enable model optimizations
