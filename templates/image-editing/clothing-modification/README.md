## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Basic Clothing Repainting

1. **Image Preparation**
   - Upload clear, well-lit fashion photos
   - Ensure good contrast between clothing and background
   - Works best with solid-color garments initially

2. **Segmentation Setup**
   - SAM2 automatically detects clothing regions
   - Manual mask refinement available if needed
   - Multiple garment selection supported

3. **Color Selection**
   - Choose target colors from palette
   - HSV adjustment controls available
   - Maintain fabric texture option enabled

4. **Processing Configuration**
   - Inpainting strength: 0.7-0.9 typical
   - Color blending mode: Overlay/Multiply/Screen
   - Edge feathering for natural transitions
   - Quality vs. speed trade-off settings

5. **Execute Transformation**
   - Monitor segmentation quality
   - Allow full processing for best results
   - Multiple variations can be generated

### Advanced Editing Features

#### Fabric Type Simulation
- **Cotton/Casual** - Soft, matte textures
- **Silk/Luxury** - Glossy, flowing appearance  
- **Denim/Rough** - Textured, structured look
- **Leather/Synthetic** - High gloss, smooth finish

#### Pattern Application
- **Solid Colors** - Uniform color application
- **Gradients** - Smooth color transitions
- **Textures** - Fabric pattern overlays
- **Prints** - Custom pattern integration

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Speed Settings
| Mode | Processing Time | Quality | VRAM Usage |
|------|----------------|---------|------------|
| Fast | 30-60 seconds | Good | 8GB |
| Balanced | 2-3 minutes | High | 12GB |
| Premium | 4-5 minutes | Excellent | 16GB |

### Quality Factors
- **Resolution Impact:** Higher input = longer processing
- **Complexity:** Multiple garments increase time
- **Detail Level:** Texture preservation adds overhead
- **Batch Size:** Multiple colors processed in sequence

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Optimal Results
1. **Input Image Quality**
   - Use high-resolution photos (1024x1024+)
   - Ensure good lighting and contrast
   - Avoid heavily shadowed areas

2. **Garment Selection**
   - Solid colors work better than complex patterns
   - Clear garment boundaries essential
   - Avoid wrinkled or folded clothing initially

3. **Color Choices**
   - Consider fabric type when selecting colors
   - Test with similar hue families first
   - Gradual changes often more believable

4. **Post-Processing**
   - Fine-tune color saturation if needed
   - Blend edges manually if required
   - Consider lighting adjustments

### Common Use Cases

#### Fashion E-commerce
- **Product Variations** - Show items in multiple colors
- **Inventory Simulation** - Visualize unavailable colors
- **Market Testing** - Test color popularity
- **Cost Reduction** - Avoid physical photoshoots
